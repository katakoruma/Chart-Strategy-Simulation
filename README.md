# Performance Simulation Project

This project is focused on simulating the performance of trading strategies over a given period. It includes various methods to simulate and analyze trading performance, including constant timesteps, constant gain, and swing trading strategies.

## Key Components

### performance_simulation.py

This script contains the `PerformanceAnalyzer`, `ChartSimulation`, and `ChartImport` classes, which are used to simulate and analyze trading performance. Key methods include:
- `simulate_performance`: Simulates the performance based on the specified mode (e.g., fixed gain phase or fixed return).
- `random_swing_trade`: Simulates random swing trades.
- `swing_trade`: Simulates swing trades based on trends and gradients in the data.
- `buy_and_hold`: Simulates a buy-and-hold strategy for the entire investment period.
- `load_data`: Loads and optionally normalizes historical data from a CSV file or multiple sources.
- `internal_rate_of_return`: Calculates the internal rate of return (IRR) for a given performance.
- `plot_performance`: Visualizes the performance of various strategies over time.
- `print_results`: Summarizes the results of the simulations in a structured format.

### msci_compare.py

This script compares the performance of the simulated trading strategies with historical data from the MSCI World Index. It uses the `PerformanceAnalyzer` class to load data and perform the analysis.

### tests.py

This script contains unit tests for the `PerformanceAnalyzer` class using the `pytest` framework. It includes tests for:
- Simulating performance
- Random swing trades
- Swing trades
- Buy-and-hold strategy
- Loading data
- Calculating internal rate of return
- Plotting performance

### Trading_Rendite.py

This script calculates the trading returns based on a simple trading strategy. It simulates buying and selling an instrument over a specified number of iterations and calculates the final account balance, total costs, and end value of the instrument.

### MonteCarloSimulation

The `MonteCarloSimulation` class enables running multiple simulations in parallel for both artificial and imported chart data. Key methods include:
- `mc_artificial_chart`: Runs Monte Carlo simulations on artificial chart data.
- `mc_import_chart`: Runs Monte Carlo simulations on imported chart data.
- `hist_performance`: Plots a histogram of performance distributions for different strategies.

## Getting Started

To run the simulations and analyses, you will need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tqdm joblib numba pytest
```

You can then run the scripts and tests as needed. For example, to run the performance simulation and compare it with historical data, you can execute:

```bash
python performance_simulation.py
python msci_compare.py
```

To run the tests, you can use:

```bash
pytest tests.py
```

## Features

- **Flexible Simulation**: Simulate various trading strategies, including random swing trades, swing trades, and buy-and-hold.
- **Monte Carlo Simulations**: Perform parallelized Monte Carlo simulations for robust analysis.
- **Data Import**: Load and normalize historical data from single or multiple sources with rebalancing support.
- **Visualization**: Plot performance and distribution of results for better insights.
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Calculate metrics such as absolute return, relative performance, TTWROR, yearly performance, and internal rate of return.

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive framework for simulating and analyzing trading performance using various strategies. It includes methods for loading and normalizing historical data, simulating performance, and analyzing the results. Î¤he Monte Carlo simulations provide robust insights into strategy performance.
